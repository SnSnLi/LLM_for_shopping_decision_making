Additionally, some reviews are quite vague, reflecting that many customers may not have much to say beyond simply enjoying the gift card.\n\n### 4. Preference Analysis:\n- **Style and Design Aspects**: The design and style of the gift card are not discussed in the reviews, which suggests that aesthetics may not be a primary concern for buyers.

I\\'ve ordered many of the Amazon tins, & some with the greeting cards, & this is one of my favorites!  It is Super Adorable, & a great way to give a gift card for any Amazon Fan!\\n\\nThe little brown box is about 4.5\" x 3\" x 1\" tall. The inside comes with a removable brown flap that holds the gift card perfectly.\\n\\nOpen the flap & it reveals the gift card inside. The top flaps seem like they are magnetic because when you go to reclose they snap back into place. The bottom has a clear window that allows you to see inside. Small print on the back- Amazon Gift cards, made in China. I chose the \"Thank you\" gift card. (see attached pics). This little gift box comes free with the purchase of your gift card. You can reuse it, or swap out the gift card if you choose.\\n\\nIt arrives with inside an outer box, so it should arrive safe & sound.\\n\\nWould it make a great gift? Definitely!  Amazon is a great card to give because there are So many choices of what to spend it on. Unlike other gift cards where you are stuck to a particular retailer/restaurant. etc, this gives you a variety. I like purchasing gift cards in $25 quantities so I can have a quick gift in hand just in case I need a quick or unexpected gift.\\n\\nRecommended for:  I recommend this for anyone who loves shopping on Amazon. If you or your gift recipient love getting that Amazon brown box delivery, then you will be giddy when you see this adorable box!\\n\\nIdeas: You can purchase this & swap out the gift cards. So, for example, it doesnt appear they are still offering the thank you card with this box (like when I bought it).  You could purchase one of the other \"thank you\" gift cards (in box, card, etc), & then purchase a one of these mini box ones & swap the 2 cards. Or use 1 of the gift cards for yourself for future purchases.\\n\\nAt the time I\\'m writing this review, it appears you can purchase the gift cards in $25-$2000 amounts.

Food is great and they have a kid's menu that my kids really enjoy.\\n\\nObviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card.  When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off.  We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price.  Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal.\", 'Great gift', 'they are gift cards', \"I ordered a bunch of gift cards and when the people went to use them, they found they didn't have anything on them.

One reason I really love the gift card is that I can use it to pay for both myself and my dining friend better than using cash.  When I am paying with cash, several of my friends argue about it and insist on paying.  Sometimes, I want to pay, and I don\\'t want them feeling guilty or fighting over who is paying.  When you have a gift card, you can just say, \"Let me pay.  I have this gift card.\"  They never turn down the offer.\\n\\nNow, about the restaurant.  I love nearly all the menu items, but I really REALLLLY love the Zuppa Toscana, so I usually get the unlimited soup, salad & breadsticks lunch special for $6.99.  Lunch is served fast and I always can get in and out in under an hour.  They always let me take the rest with me, even happy to provide more soup, salad and breadsticks and box it up, so, since I\\'m single, that\\'s dinner.  Always great service, and let\\'s not forget the after dinner mints.  YUM!', \"Olive Garden overcharged their customers for worst food they made. Upon arrival at a local Olive Garden branch in October 2014, my friends and I saw only a few customers sit there so we should be assigned a seat quickly. There were several welcoming representatives just talking to each other and one told us that we had to wait at least 20 minutes to get seated.\\n\\nAfter the dirty and sour meal, we were overcharged and were forced to pay 20% service fee as tips. If it's a good meal and service, we might pay more than 30% of dinner price as tip but we had a horrible dining experience in Olive Garden. After all, we would never visit Olive Garden again because such a bad restaurant kept ripping people off. I have seen bad reviews on this restaurant from other people on other sites too.\", 'Love it!!!! Thanks!!!!', \"Olive Garden is good, not your authentic Italian food but it does the trick for a chain restaurant. Some prices are a little high but the fact you get salad and bread sticks with your dinner (for takeout too) makes it worth it.

Perfect for gifting!', 'QUICK AND WORKED GREAT!', 'Great product from a great seller!!!!', \"I was weary about purchasing this product because of all of those 1-star reviews. I decided to take the plunge, though, because I had $65 on my Amazon Gift Card balance. My Prime membership had expired, I hoped that I could use my Amazon Gift card balance to renew it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't appear to be possible. I wanted to treat myself, though, so I went ahead and took a chance on this e-gift card for Ulta so I could pick up some skin care and makeup necessities. Very glad that I did, despite the reviews. That being said, there are a few things that I have learned from buying e-gift cards on Amazon, and I hope these tips can help. First, for in-person orders, do not bother having them scan the bar code, it never works - instead, just read the numbers off to them, simple. Second, if you copy and paste the 16 digit card number, you will need to manually remove the spaces or else it won't register (that's how it is with Dominos, anyway). Dumb, I know, but if it isn't working, try removing the spaces just in case. Third, when shopping at Ulta.com you CANNOT use more than one gift card. Why is that a problem? Because to use the ENTIRETY of my Amazon balance, I had to purchase two separate cards in the amounts of $30 and $35. I didn't want any remaining balance lingering as I have no idea when I'll have the extra funds to renew my Prime membership. This was an inconvenience because I had to split my Ulta purchases into two separate orders. Fourth, apparently the recipient needs to have an Amazon membership. If you are gifting a young person who isn't able to make an Amazon account you could always send the gift card to yourself and then send the card number and pin to the recipient. I have purchased E-Gift Cards off of Amazon for the following companies: P.F. Chang's, Domino's, Ulta, Panda Express, and Chipotle, and haven't had any issues with any of them. It just sounds like Amazon customer service isn't very good at helping people troubleshoot technical issues Order was successful, and if you are still reading, I really hope that this review has helped you make a decision regarding whether or not to purchase. If you have the time, it is usually worthwhile to go for the physical card, but these E-Gift cards are still quite convenient if you are in a pinch or have a long-distance recipient.\", 'It arrived within 5 minutes and worked exactly as it should. E-mail delivery gift cards take the waiting out of gift card purchases; I love them.']"
